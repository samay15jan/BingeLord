Welcome to Binge Lord, a project born out of my passion for movies/series and the desire to create an immersive streaming experience. Leveraging TMDB for movie data and Vidsrc for streaming, Binge Lord is a feature-packed platform built with React.

## Demo

https://github.com/samay15jan/BingeLord/assets/97271429/568d2228-bc2a-421a-89bf-fe5e7ff16303

## Features

- **Movie/Series Information**: Utilizes [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) API to fetch data.

- **Streaming**: Seamless video streaming powered by [Vidsrc](https://vidsrc.me/).
  
- **Real-time Search**: Find your favorite movies or TV shows instantly with filters.
  
- **Detailed Pages**: Discover trailers, images, ratings, cast, and more.
  
- **Watchlist**: Save movies/series for later with Firebase Realtime Database.
  
- **User Authentication**: Securely log in using Firebase authentication.

- **Responsive Design**: Experience a seamless UI on both desktop and mobile.



## Technologies Used


**Client:** React, TailwindCSS, React-Router, CSS-in-JS Libraries (styled + twin.macro)

**Server:** Node, Firebase, Express (As a proxy to make API calls)

**Hosting:** Render(Seperate Client and Server), Cron-Job (to keep server alive)
